# TravelSite - Online Travel Reservation System
In this project, our group (team of 4) have designed and implemented a relational database system to support the
operations of an online travel reservation system. We have used HTML for the user interface,
MySQL for the database server, and Java JDBC for the backend connectivity between the user interface and
the database server.

The travel site includes the following functionality:
- Admin-level functionality
A site admin can: 
• Add, Edit and Delete information for a customer representative or customer
• Obtain a sales report for a particular month
• Produce a list of reservations by flight number or by customer name
• Produce a summary listing of revenue generated by a particular flight, airline or customer
• Determine which customer generated most total revenue
• Produce a list of most active flights (most tickets sold)
• Produce a list of all flights for a given airport 

- Customer-Representative-Level Functionality 
Customer Representatives can:
• Make flight reservations on behalf of users
• Edit flight reservations for a customer
• Add, Edit, Delete information for aircrafts, airports and flights
• Retrieve a list of all the passengers who are on the waiting list of a particular flight

- Customer-Level Functionality 
Customers can buy online airline tickets and can browse the travel site. In particular, they can search and make the following types of reservations:
• One-Way
• Round-Trip
• Flexible Date/time

Also customers can:
• sort flights by different criteria (price, take-off time, landing time)
• filter the list of flights by various criteria (price, number of stops, airline)
• cancel their flight reservations (if it is business or first class)
• enter the waiting list if the flight is full 
• view all the past reservations with their details
• view all the upcoming reservations with their details
